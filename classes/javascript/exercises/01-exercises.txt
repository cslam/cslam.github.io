1) Add embedded JavaScript into a HTML page, add some comments

2) Create a JavaScript file and include it in a HTML page

3) What variables names would you create to describe parts of a rectangle and the operations you can perform on it.

4) For each name, answer if it is a valid or invalid JavaScript variable:
    a) $one
    b) _person
    c) 15dollars
    d) var
    e) VAR
    
5) Create two variables assign them some number and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them. Save each result to a variable and output them using console.log.

6) How many different ways can you increment a number by 1 using JavaScript operators?

7) How can you modulo operator to determine if a number is odd or even?

8) For each logical operation, answer whether it returns true or false

var num1 = 10, num2 = 20, num3 = 30

a) (num1 === num2) && (num3 < 50)
b) (num1 === num2) || (num3 < 50)
c) (num1 > 0) && (num2 > 0)
d) (num1 !== 10) || (num2 !== 20)

9) Write separate functions for add, subtract, multiply and divide and have them return the answer. Call these functions passing in the right arguments and console.log the return values. What happens if you pass in a string number as a argument? or a non-number?

10) Create a calculator object with add, subtract, multiply, division methods.
