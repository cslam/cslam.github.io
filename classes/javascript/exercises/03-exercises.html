  1)  Create a web page and listen for the window's load and the document's 
    DOMContentLoaded events. Observe which event fires first.
    Now add an img tag that points to this ~32MB image:

    Do you see the benefit of using DOMContentLoaded over the load event?

      2)  Create a web page that changes its background color based on whether the current 
          system time is in AM or PM. Look for the .getHours method of the Date class to help you.

3)  Create a web page, and using JavaScript add 10 &lt;p&gt; tags with each one having
    some text content that indicates what order it is in. For example, the first
    &lt;p&gt; would have text that says "This is paragraph #1". The second &lt;p&gt; would
    have text that says "This is paragraph #2", etc.
    
    Use JavaScript to style the odd (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc) &lt;p&gt; tags with a background
    color of yellow. Style the even &lt;p&gt; tags with background color of blue.
    
    Add click event handler for the &lt;p&gt; element. Use event delegation to accomplish it. 
    You can have the event handler print something to the console.
