      1)  What will the following return?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a) true &amp;&amp; false
      </li>
      <li>
        b) false &amp;&amp; true
      </li>
      <li>
        c) 100 || ""
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
      2)  Create a function with the name "greeting" that requires a parameter called "txt". 
          The function should just print what's contained in "txt" to the console 
          using console.log. Provide a default value for "txt" if the function is
          invoked without a value for "txt".
    </p>
      
      
    <p>
      3)  A list of student grades are stored in an array: [85, 10, 7, 52, 77, 90, 40]. 
          How would you find the average grade?
          How can you find the lowest grade? 
          The highest grade?
    </p>
      
    <p>
      4)  Arrays have a method call .sort() that sorts an array lexicographically.
          The .sort method can also take a "compare" function as its argument. 
          If you pass a "compare" function, then the .sort method will use that function
          to compare the items in its array.
          The "compare" function has to define two parameters representing the current 
          two items in an array that need to be compared:
    </p>
      
<pre>
      function compareNumbers(a, b) {
        if (a < b) {
          // if a is less than b, then a comes before b. 
          // return -1 to let the .sort method know that.
          return -1;
        } else if (a > b) {
          // if a is more than b, then a comes after b.
          // return 1 to let the .sort method know that.
          return 1;
        } else {
          // a must be equal to b.
          // return 0 to let the .sort method know that.
          return 0;
        }
      }
</pre>
      
    <p>
      Using the .sort method, sort the array of student grades, without a compare 
      function passed as argument. Are the grades sorted numerically?
      Sort the array again, passing the compareNumbers function and check how the
      grades are sorted.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      5)  Write a loop that will find the sum of numbers from 25 to 50. (25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + ... + 50)
    </p>

    <p>
      6)  How can you use the modulo operator to determine if a number is odd or even?
          Write a loop that will go through this array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and 
          separate the odd and even numbers into their own arrays.
    </p>

    <p>
      7)  The typeof operator takes a value and tells you what data type it is:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        typeof 100; // evaluates to "number"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof true; // evaluates to "boolean"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof function () {}; // evaluates to "function"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof "Hello"; // evaluates to "string"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof null; // evaluates to "object"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof undefined; // evaluates to "undefined"
      </li>
      <li>
        typeof {}; // evaluates to "object"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Modify the "add" function so that if user passes in a non-number it should return null.
    </p>

    <p>
      8)  Create a Calculator constructor with add, subtract, multiply, and divide methods defined 
          on the .prototype object. These methods do not take any arguments.  Instead, define two
          properties for Calculator called operand1 and operand2. You will set the operands there.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      This is how you would use the calculator:
    </p>
<pre>
      var calculator = new Calculator();
      calculator.operand1 = 100;
      calculator.operand2 = 25;
      var sum = calculator.add();
      console.log(sum); // prints 125
      var diff = calculator.subtract();
      console.log(diff); // prints 75
      var product = calculator.multiply(); 
      console.log(product); // prints 2500
</pre>  
    <p>
      9)  In JavaScript you can compare two strings for equality using ===.
          But since JavaScript is case-sensitive, the following is false:
    </p>
<pre>
      "hello" === "Hello"
</pre>
    <p>
      Write code to compare two strings without worrying about 
      case-sensitivity. (As long as the letters and order of the letters are
      the same.)
      Hint: Use one of the string methods.
    </p>
